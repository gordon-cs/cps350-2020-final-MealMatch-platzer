# CPS350 Final App: NoReservations
by Evan Platzer

## Project Proposal

### Target Users

This app aims to help everyone who has the recurring difficulty of deciding where to eat with a group. When sharing a meal with a group, people commonly reach a stalemate where everyone wants to be polite, so no one makes a decision about where to eat for fear of forcing their opinion onto others. NoReservations helps solve this problem by letting each person select restaurants they'd enjoy until the group has agreed on a particular spot.
